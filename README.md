# configEdit
This is a simple bash script that takes config files of your choosing and pipes them into dmenu so that you can quickly choose a confi file to edit. To have this work on your system simply add/change the variables to reflect the correct config file names and paths, also if needed, change your editor from Neovim to what you use.
